## Overview
The **Pulse Social Media Application** is a modern, feature-rich social media platform built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It provides a complete social media experience where users can create accounts, post content, like, comment, and follow others. The app is designed to deliver a seamless user experience with real-time notifications and responsive design for both mobile and desktop.

### The challenge
The challenge of building this application was to create a fully functional social media platform that:
- Supports **user authentication** (login, registration).
- Allows users to **post content** (text, images).
- Provides **social interaction** features such as likes, comments, and following users.
- Uses **MongoDB** for storing user data, posts, comments, etc.
- Implements a **real-time notification system** to notify users of activities (likes, comments, follows).
- Is fully responsive, providing a great user experience across devices.

### Features
- **User Authentication:** Sign up, log in, and manage profiles with JWT-based authentication.
- **Post Creation:** Users can create posts, including text and images.
- **Like & Comment:** Users can like and comment on posts.
- **Follow/Unfollow:** Users can follow and unfollow other users.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Users receive notifications for activities like likes, comments, and follows.
- **Responsive Design:** The app adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens for a smooth experience.
- **Dashboard:** A user dashboard to view posts, followers, and notifications.

### Technologies Used
- **MongoDB** for database management (storing users, posts, comments).
- **Express.js** for backend API development.
- **React** for building a dynamic frontend.
- **Node.js** as the runtime environment for backend development.
- **JWT** for user authentication (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Socket.io** for real-time notifications (new likes, comments, follows).
- **Mongoose** for interacting with MongoDB.
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests from the frontend.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed (for backend and frontend development).
- MongoDB instance (either locally or through a service like MongoDB Atlas).
- Basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pulse-social-media-application.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pulse-social-media-application
   ```

3. Set up the **backend**:
   - Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file with the following content:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. Set up the **frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. The app should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend API.

### Usage
1. **User Authentication:** Sign up or log in to the app. The JWT token will be used for authentication and authorization.
2. **Post Creation:** After logging in, you can create posts by adding text and images.
3. **Likes & Comments:** Interact with posts by liking and commenting on them.
4. **Following:** Follow or unfollow other users to see their posts in your feed.
5. **Notifications:** Get real-time notifications whenever someone interacts with your posts.

### Future Improvements
- **Direct Messaging:** Implement private messaging between users.
- **Post Editing/Deletion:** Allow users to edit or delete their posts.
- **Advanced Search:** Add the ability to search for users, posts, or comments.
- **Profile Customization:** Let users update their profile information and avatar.
- **Post Media:** Add support for video uploads along with images.
- **Dark Mode:** Add a toggle to switch between light and dark modes for better UX.
- **User Verification:** Implement email verification for new users.
